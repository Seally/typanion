> Type-safe CLI library with no dependencies

## Installation

```
yarn add typanion
```

## Why

  - Typanion can validate nested arbitrary data structures
  - Typanion is type-safe; it uses [type predicates](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#user-defined-type-guards)
  - Typanion allows you to derive types from your schemas

Note: Typanion's standard library isn't huge at the moment (mostly strings, arrays, shapes), more types are expected in future versions.

## Usage

First define a schema using the builtin operators:

```ts
import * as type from 'typanion';

const movie = type.object({
    title: type.string(),
    description: type.string(),
});
```

Then just call the schema to validate any `unknown` value:

```ts
const userData = JSON.parse(input);

if (movie(userData)) {
    console.log(userData.title);
}
```

You can derive the type from the schema for use in other functions:

```ts
import * as type from 'typanion';

const movie = type.object({
    title: type.string(),
    description: type.string(),
});

type Movie = type.InferType<typeof movie>;

// Then just use your alias:
const printMovie = (movie: Movie) => {
    // ...
};
```

Types can be kept in separate variables if needed:

```ts
import * as type from 'typanion';

const actor = type.object({
    name: type.string();
});

const movie = type.object({
    title: type.string(),
    description: type.string(),
    actors: type.array(actor),
});
```
