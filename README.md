# Typanion

> Static and runtime type assertion library with no dependencies

## Installation

```
yarn add typanion
```

## Why

- Typanion can validate nested arbitrary data structures
- Typanion is type-safe; it uses [type predicates](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#user-defined-type-guards)
- Typanion allows you to derive types from your schemas
- Typanion can report detailed error reports

Compared to [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup), Typanion has a better inference support for TypeScript + supports `isOneOf`. Its functional API makes it very easy to tree shake, which is another bonus (although the library isn't very large in itself).

## Usage

First define a schema using the builtin operators:

```ts
import * as t from 'typanion';

const isMovie = t.isObject({
    title: t.isString(),
    description: t.isString(),
});
```

Then just call the schema to validate any `unknown` value:

```ts
const userData = JSON.parse(input);

if (isMovie(userData)) {
    console.log(userData.title);
}
```

Passing a second parameter allows you to retrieve detailed errors:

```ts
const userData = JSON.parse(input);
const errors: string[] = [];

if (!isMovie(userData, errors)) {
    console.log(errors);
}
```

You can derive the type from the schema and use it in other functions:

```ts
import * as t from 'typanion';

const isMovie = t.isObject({
    title: t.isString(),
    description: t.isString(),
});

type Movie = t.InferType<typeof isMovie>;

// Then just use your alias:
const printMovie = (movie: Movie) => {
    // ...
};
```

Schemas can be stored in multiple variables if needed:

```ts
import * as t from 'typanion';

const isActor = t.isObject({
    name: t.isString();
});

const isMovie = t.isObject({
    title: t.isString(),
    description: t.isString(),
    actors: t.isArray(isActor),
});
```

## API

### Type predicates

- `isArray(spec)` will ensure that the values are arrays whose values all match the specified schema.

- `isBoolean()` will ensure that the values are all booleans. Note that to specifically check for either `true` or `false`, you can look for `isLiteral`.

- `isLiteral(value)` will ensure that the values are strictly equal to the specified expected value. It's an handy tool that you can combine with `oneOf` and `object` to parse structures similar to Redux actions, etc. Note that you'll need to annotate your value with `as const` in order to let TypeScript know that the exact value matters (otherwise it'll cast it to `string` instead).

- `isNumber()` will ensure that the values are all numbers.

- `isObject(props)` will ensure that the values are plain old objects whose properties match the given shape.

- `isString()` will ensure that the values are all regular strings.

- `isUnknown()` will accept whatever is the input without validating it, but without refining the type inference either. Note that by default `isUnknown` will forbid `undefined` and `null`, but this can be switched off by explicitly allowing them via `isOptional` and `isNullable`.

### Helper predicates

- `applyCascade(spec, [specA, specB, ...])` will ensure that the values all match `spec` and, if they do, run the followup validations as well. Since those followups will not contribute to the inference (only the lead schema will), you'll typically want to put here anything that's a logical validation, rather than a typed one (cf the [Cascading Predicates](#Cascading-predicate) section).

- `isOneOf([specA, specB])` will ensure that the values all match any of the provided schema. As a result, the inferred type is the union of all candidates. The predicate supports an option, `exclusive`, which ensures that only one variant matches.

- `isOptional(spec)` will add `undefined` as an allowed value for the given specification.

- `isNullable(spec)` will add `null` as an allowed value for the given specification.

### Cascading predicates

- `hasExactLength` will ensure that the values all have a `length` property exactly equal to the specified value.

- `hasMaxLength` will ensure that the values all have a `length` property at most equal to the specified value.

- `hasMinLength` will ensure that the values all have a `length` property at least equal to the specified value.

- `isAtLeast` will ensure that the values compare positively with the specified value.

- `isAtMost` will ensure that the values compare positively with the specified value.

- `isInExclusiveRange` will ensure that the values compare positively with the specified value.

- `isInInclusiveRange` will ensure that the values compare positively with the specified value.

- `isInteger` will ensure that the values are round integers.

- `isLowerCase` will ensure that the values only contain lowercase characters.

- `isNegative` will ensure that the values are at most 0.

- `isPositive` will ensure that the values are at least 0.

- `isUpperCase` will ensure that the values only contain uppercase characters.

- `isUUID4` will ensure that the values are valid UUID 4 strings.

- `matchesRegExp` will ensure that the values all match the given regular expression.
